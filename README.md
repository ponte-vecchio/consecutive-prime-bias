# Simulation of Biases in the Distribution of Consecutive Primes using Chebyshev and Riemann Prime Functions

The purpose of this project was to design a heuristic to simulate and observe the biases in the distribution of consecutive primes with differing *a* values of π(*x*;*q*,*a*) based on Riemann Prime Function, and the occurrence of vartheta(a) from Chebyshev’s Prime Counting Function through MATLAB.
